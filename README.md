# Energy Consumption Prediction

## Project Overview
This project is dedicated to predicting energy consumption using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. A key feature of this project is the implementation of real-time energy consumption prediction using Spark Streaming integrated with an XGBoost machine learning model.

## Features
- Importing and analyzing energy consumption data.
- Implementing the XGBoost machine learning model for predictive analysis.
- Feature preparation and engineering to enhance model performance.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Real-time data processing and visualization with Spark Streaming, integrating the pre-trained XGBoost model.
